## Student Performance - End to End Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the performance of students based on various factors such as demographics, family background, and academic history. The project uses a dataset of student information that includes both numerical and categorical data.<br>

The project is built using Python programming language and several popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc. The project also utilizes Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.<br>

Dataset<br>
The dataset used in this project is the "Student Performance" dataset, which contains 1,000 student records with 8 attributes. The dataset can be found in the student-performance.csv file, which is included in the project directory.<br>

The attributes in the dataset are:<br>

gender: student's gender (binary: "male" or "female")<br>
race/ethnicity: student's race/ethnicity (categorical: "group A" to "group E")<br>
parental level of education: parental education level (categorical: high school, some college, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or master's degree)<br>
lunch: student's lunch type (binary: standard or free/reduced)<br>
test preparation course: whether the student completed a test preparation course (binary: completed or none)<br>
math score: student's math score (numerical: 0-100)<br>
reading score: student's reading score (numerical: 0-100)<br>
writing score: student's writing score (numerical: 0-100)<br>

Project Structure<br>
The project directory contains the following files:<br>

stud.csv: the dataset file<br>
Student Performance - End to End Machine Learning Project.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook that contains the project code<br>
README.md: this file, which provides an overview of the project<br>
How to Run the Project<br>
To run the project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can follow these steps:<br>

Clone the project repository or download the project files<br>
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory<br>
Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda<br>
Activate the virtual environment<br>
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Launch Jupyter Notebook using jupyter notebook<br>
Open the Student Performance - open the notebook and run the code cells<br>
Alternatively, you can run the project in a cloud environment such as Google Colab or Kaggle.<br>

Conclusion<br>
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of a machine learning project, including data preparation, data exploration, data visualization, model selection, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment. The project can be used as a template for similar machine learning projects in education or other domains.
